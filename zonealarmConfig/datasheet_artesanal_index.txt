FWOUT: indicates that the firewall blocked an outbound packet of data from leaving your computer. 

FWROUTE - the firewall blocked a packet that was not addressed to or from your computer, but was routed through it. 

FWLOOP - the firewall blocked a packet addressed to the loopback adapter (127.0.0.1) 

LOCK - the firewall blocked a packet due to a lock violation 

PE: indicates that an application on your computer requested access to the Internet. 

N/A: "Not Applicable" - for any log file entries (often PE) with less than 6 fields to report, ZA/ZAP will pad that line with "N/A" ACCESS - an application was blocked because it did not have access permission
